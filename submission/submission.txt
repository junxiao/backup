Transform your iPhone or iPod Touch (with front facing camera) into a security camera.

With this app, you can set your iPhone/iPod Touch to take pictures whenever it detects motion in the camera scene and email you the pictures. Just put your device on a stationary dock that aims towards the scene you want to monitor, fire the app, and specify when to start and stop the monitoring during the day.
As this app uses computer vision techniques to detect motion, you should NOT putting the device in an area with low light or constant lighting or scene changes (spinning wheels, TV screen etc) to avoid false alarm. 

Do NOT to use this application for any illegal and unethical purpose and violate the privacy rights of others. This product is for home/personal use and not intended for professional surveillance or spying.

Settings of the app:
* The email address and server information of where the email should be sent from. And the email address of where the pictures should be sent. Tip: you can email the pictures to your Flickr account (http://www.flickr.com/account/uploadbyemail/).
* Hour of start and stop each day (8am-6pm by default).
* Show or hide the camera view and show or hide iAds.
*Sensitivity of the motion detection: lower the value will make the app only detect movement of larger objects in the scene and reduce false alarm.

Limitation in the current version:
* Does NOT detect sound disturbance. 
* Front facing camera capture only. 
* Does NOT store any pictures on your device.
* Does NOT record video.
* 20 seconds delay in sending email (avoid overwhelming the email server).


Let's ignore for the moment that your $200 to $300 iPhone is significantly more expensive than, say, a webcam. Let's also gloss over the fact that while many actual surveillance cameras may cost in this price range, they also don't tend to contain your personal correspondence and that "OMG ur hot" photo you took of yourself in the mirror last week.
­Yes, in the face of all acceptable logic, you can fulfill that insatiable MacGyver craving in your soul and turn your phone/fashion accessory/status symbol into an instrument of security, espionage or blackmail.
Just how do you pull off this feat? Paw your touch screen and slide over to the next page to find out.

Again, it's difficult to argue that turning your iPhone into a security camera is a sensible move. Leaving it out to help protect items from theft makes about as much sense as building a scarecrow out of corn and earthworms. Yet maybe you have some nefarious scheme in mind to catch a roommate or spouse in the act of, say, putting the milk carton back empty -- or worse. Hey, you're the one looking to breach some trust. You have your reasons. Just don't blame us when iPhones are stolen or hearts are broken.

With this app, you can set your iPhone to take pictures at a pre-defined set of interval in minutes, or just about every time the mic on the iPhone detects any sound.
Features of Security Cam app for iPhone are as follows.
make sure your phone is on Wi-Fi
the iPod universal dock and iPhone 3G dock are both angled in such a way

lace it in an area with constant lighting changes, those changes in light will appear to the application as motion. Since it uses the camera to detect motion, it is looking for changes in the camera view. Some examples of what may confuse the app and appear as motion are: A spinning fan, shadows from outside on a windy day, blinking lights, a T.V. or a computer monitor (especially with a screen saver). 
Motion Detector is a stand-alone surveillance tool for your iPhone. Motion Detector automatically takes consecutive photos using iPhone's camera and performs sophisticated mathematics for motion detection. When motion is detected, Motion Detector can start automatic recording and/or Email notification, so you will have physical records of what has happened.  Features:  * Motion detection using sophisticated mathematical models. * Automatic Email notification. * Automatic trigger recording of subsequent photos. * Recording playback.  Limitations: 
Video Motion Alert (VM Alert) is an advanced video processing application for the iPhone capable of detecting motion seen by the iPhone camera. VM Alert can use either the rear or front facing camera. VM Alert can be configured to sound a pleasant or alarming audible alert when it detects motion and can optionally save images of the motion conveniently to the iPhone camera roll.    Usage   VM Alert is simple to use. Simply start the app, aim the camera at the scene to be monitored, and set the iPhone on a stable surface. After about 3-5 seconds of being still, the app will automatically arm. (The app uses the internal accelerometer to determine when it is no longer moving.) While armed, it will alert on any motion seen by the camera. To disarm, simply pick up the phone.    Applications   Intruder Alert  Use VM Alert at your hotel watching the door while you sleep. Use it in the shower to alert you to anyone entering the bathroom door.   Visitor Notification  Use VM Alert to notify you when the mailman visits your door or someone arrives at your office.   Spy Camera  Use VM Alert as a spy camera by simply turning off the audible alert and turning on image capture. Hide your iPhone where the camera can see what you want to monitor and images of any motion will be saved to your camera roll. The images can then be easily downloaded into iPhoto or sent via email.   Private Investigators  Use VM Alert as a surveillance aid. Aim it at the door or driveway of your target to ensure you will be alerted when they leave the area.    Configuration Options   Use Front Camera  This option is only compatible with the iPhone 4. It has no effect on the 3GS.   Alert Sensitivity  This option controls how sensitive the motion detection is. To the left is the least sensitive, and to the right is the most sensitive.   Add OSD To Image  This option adds an On Screen Display of the areas of motion that are being detected. It will appear as a semi-transparent white overlay.   Beep When Arming  This option controls whether or not an audible beep is heard when the VM Alert arms.   Sound Alert  This option controls whether or not an alert sound is played when motion is detected.   Save Image to Album  This option controls whether or not motion images are saved to the camera roll.   Alert Sound  This option is determines the sound that is played when motion is detected if the 'Sound Alert' option is turned on.    Hints   VM Alert requires that the phone be stable to effectively detect motion. The iPhone cradle is recommended to secure the device.   VM Alert uses resources on the iPhone that are power intensive. It is recommended that your iPhone be plugged in for extended usage.  The iPhone camera has reasonable but not superb low-light performance. If it is completely dark, VM Alert will not be able to see motion. However, an opening door often provides ambient light that will improve performance and allow for detection.   In low light scenarios, you may want to turn the brightness down on the iPhone.

** Please read the Notices at the end of this description **  Motion Activated Audio and Video Recorder works with iPhone and iTouch.  We used it to catch which one of our dogs was stealing treats from the kitchen counter. See the sample video here: http://MAVideo.JellyFilledStudios.com  Automatically starts audio and video recording when it detects any movement within view of the camera. Recording will continue until about 10 seconds after motion has stopped.   A Time stamp is placed on every frame of the video recording.   All recordings are stored with the application and will automatically delete after 5 days. Clips you want to keep can be combined together and moved to your iOS Photo Library in a video format that can be sync'd to your computer or shared via SMS.  Run in stealth mode with a clock view or in standard mode with a notice displayed informing anyone within view that audio and video surveillance is active.  Warning: Do not to use this application for any illegal purpose. If not used correctly, covert cameras and audio recording devices may violate the privacy rights of others. This product is for home/personal use and not intended for professional surveillance or spying.  ** Notices: After seeing one comment where a user states the app doesn't work, I thought it should be clarified that the app does work extremely well. However, if you place it in an area with constant lighting changes, those changes in light will appear to the application as motion. Since it uses the camera to detect motion, it is looking for changes in the camera view. Some examples of what may confuse the app and appear as motion are: A spinning fan, shadows from outside on a windy day, blinking lights, a T.V. or a computer monitor (especially with a screen saver). Also, placing it in an area with no lighting can be a problem since it must be able to see via the camera. The iPhone and iTouch cameras do see infrared light, so if you wanted to use this application in the dark it would work as long as you provide sufficient infrared lighting to the scene
